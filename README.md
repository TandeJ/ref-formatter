# Ref-Formatter

It happens every time you have an essay to write. There are 2 minutes left before the deadline, and you've just remembered that you need MLA citations or you lose 80% of the grade. You open up a citation maker hoping that things have turned around since you were here last, that all the ads and bloat are gone so you can just _make citations_.

They never change.

## Well, I should make my own!
It doesn't have fancy autocomplete or native font support or whatever. But at least it's fast and without ads?

## Please be nice I "learned" TypeScript and React for this
